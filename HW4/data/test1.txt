his iconic photo was shot at Batumoba Festival in Georgia’s beautiful coastal city of Batumi and it features a well-known elderly man who, as a rule, sits at the entrance of one of the shops holding a wishing tree in his hands and smiling at every passerby. Despite poverty and poor conditions, he keeps on smiling and telling warm and positive words to everyone. While our stay in Batumi, my friends and I often went to the nearby shop for products, so we saw this kind old man with his wishing tree every day. One day when we came out from the shop, he stopped one of my friends and talked with her for a while. Here is what she said later: “When I last saw this grandpa he was busy making his cheese.

As it turned out the old man lives in Batumi, a route taxi and needs shoes and clothes. Luckily many people expressed willingness to help this kind grandpa. As one of the Facebook pages reports, those eager to help him can go to Nugeshi Batumi shop, where the elderly usually sits, on September 6 at 3 pm and bring food, water and some warm clothes, since winter is approaching. Strange as it may sound, this photo reminds many people of famous film director Sergei Parajanov's photo where he jumps in the air from Batumi joy.
